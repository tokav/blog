## Welcome to my blog {#welcome-to-my-blog}

Iâ€™m a software developer and architect with over 15 years of experience in the tech industry. For
most of my career, I've been primarily a Java developer, but over the past few years, I've branched
out to other technologies like Python and Node.js.

This space is a record of my personal experiences, observations, and lessons learned in the trenches
of software engineering.

I hope you will find value in reviewing my notes.
